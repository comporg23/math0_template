take a look at the files.

```
cat test.c
```

take a look at `math.s` file as well.

note that the variables are global. that is the reason you will be able to use those from your assembly file.

take a look at the `makefile` too.

as you've guessed (hopefully) if you type `make` the program will be compiled.

but `math.s` contains question marks that needs to be replaced.

remember first grade in school? did you fill the letters in the words?

let's say you see an image of the pig. then there are letters `p..g`.
you should insert `i` there.
you need to do something like that here.
i believe you can!

the program will be compiled if `math.s` file will be at least syntactically correct.

but i want you to get the program to print result `42`. because that's the answer.

do something for that.

that's your task.
go!



p. s. should i remind you  that we provide you a cozy server for work?
